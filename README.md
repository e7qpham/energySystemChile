#### Scenarios for a 100% renewable electricity system in Chile

This repository demonstrates the feasibility of Chile's transition to a fully renewable electricity system. The study methodology analyzed Chile's renewable potential based on weather data from 2013 and built an energy system model of the country using the PyPSA framework. The study utilized various datasets to conduct land eligibility analysis of onshore wind, solar PV, and offshore wind potential, providing a comprehensive analysis of Chile's renewable energy potential. The performance criteria considered objective factors such as distances to airports and major roads, elevation limits, natural protection areas, and land cover classes to confidently determine eligible areas for onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar. The model scope includes a spatial resolution of six nodes in Chile and a 3-hourly time series resolution. The model initialization utilized weather data, load data distribution based on population estimates in 2017, technology assumptions for 2050, and existing power plant capacities with a high level of expertise and competence. These findings showcase Chile's immense potential for renewable energy and position the country as a leading energy producer. The study unequivocally demonstrates that Chile has abundant renewable resources, with significant potential for onshore wind in coastal regions and solar PV in the Atacama desert, resulting in a combined potential of over 994 GW. Although offshore wind potential is limited, it is still possible in the south with 25.44 GW despite the challenging coastal drop-offs and the depth of the Atacama Trench. The study notes an active decision to avoid the Easter Islands, San Felix and San Ambrosio Islands due to this geographical background. It suggests that the transmission links should run from north to south, while the offshore area should only be linked to regions close to the largest capacities. The building reflects the knowledge that fixed costs can be saved by building fewer transmission lines but with higher capacity. The decarbonization of the energy system in this country is not only the best decision from an environmental standpoint but also the most economically viable option. Due to the cost assumption underlying in the model setup, no observable difference found in the dispatch profile of both scenarios. Chile's abundant solar power resources make it highly cost-effective to utilize this technology even with current technologies. Therefore, a complete transition to a fully renewable electricity system in Chile, with a heavy reliance on solar power, battery, and hydrogen storage, is not only feasible but also highly practical and achievable.
